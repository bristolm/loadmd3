This package contains my Lightwave MD3 utilities.

I have to admit that I havn't gone further than just compiling a .MD3 with these.  The
resulting files will work in the various .MD3 utilies, but I havn't finished skinning one
because I'm not sure where to do the skinning portion.

Be sure to backup any files you consider imperative - this hasn't been tested too extensively.

In this package there are:
	README.txt 	- This file
	Q3_tag.lwo	- A 'tag' poly for use in your animations.  It has the points
			  built in the proper order so the direction can be determined
	LoadQuakeMD.p	- MODELER plugin - This is the newest version of the .MD3 importer for
			  Lightwave (5.6 & 6.0).
	LoadQuakeMD_README.txt - explanation of the aformentioned plug-in
	LWOtoMD3.exe	- This is the convertor.  Read ...
	LWOtoMD3_README.txt - explanation of the aforementioned LWOtoMD3.exe
	CheckMD3.exe	- This just runs through a .MD3 and print out the internal info

Please have faith that any examples anyone submits to me for debuggin purposes will be handled in 
the utmost confidentiality.  I won't rip meshes or anything like that.

I'm hoping to generate a tool here we all can use, so your input is really important.
Please ping me for anything that you think it should be doing, shouldn't be doing, or
should be doing better.

If you'd like to see an exportplugin, that's all well and good, but I don't really have time for 
that right now.  Besides, I think this is more flexable and (seriously) a little less 
confusing than a plugin might have been.

Thanks to id for opening these standards up for everyone to use.
Thanks to the guys at polycount for collecting all this stuff in one place.

I do troll the messageboards on polycount (www.polycount.com) so feel free to ask
questions up there.

Later,
